    "jd": "English-Chinese interpreters assist with communication between English- and Chinese-speaking people. English-Chinese interpreters convert the verbal communication of one these languages into the verbal form of the other. However, English-Chinese interpreters do more than just convert individual words from one language into another. They are knowledgeable in specific subject areas and convey ideas or attitudes that may be lost in translation due to cultural differencesEnglish-Chinese interpreters have three methods by which usually they work: simultaneous, consecutive and sight translation. When performing simultaneous interpretation, it's imperative that English-Chinese interpreters have such a complete understanding of the topic at hand that they're able to anticipate what the speaker will say next. This is because simultaneous English-Chinese interpreters have to listen to the speaker while interpreting for the listener at the same time.",
